`tables.py` will create all tables that are needed for the app to run.
`antitables.py` will delete all tables.
`main.py` contains all the back-end code.

It would be best to have `pipenv` installed on your system. Then you can simply run `pipenv install` and it will automatically install all requirements for this project.
`pipenv` can be installed using `pip install pipenv`.
